# Warzone Stats
## Android application to track player/match statistics in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Warzone)

Warzone Stats ranks player statistics and places them within leagues, something the standard call of duty tracker does not.

Leagues as follows:
- Legend (Highest)
- Master
- Diamond
- Gold
- Silver
- Bronze (Lowest)

Having these leagues adds a new dimension to a player's Call of Duty statistics.
It allows them to eaasily compare with friends and visualise the ranking of statistics, for a more fun and enjoyable experience.
It also ecourages players to improve, as they strive to get to the highest rank!
